# CriticalEdgePuzzle
This application finds all critical edges in a graph.
Edge is said to be critical if removal of edge leaves the graph disjoint.

I have used 2 approaches given in process.cs and nodeprocess.cs file. 
Either of them can be used in main() entry method.
nodeProcess() is more optimised.
